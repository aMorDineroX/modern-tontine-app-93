## Introduction

User testing with people who use assistive technologies is essential for ensuring that the Naat application is truly accessible. While automated testing and manual testing by developers can catch many issues, testing with actual users of assistive technologies provides invaluable insights into real-world usage patterns and challenges.

This guide provides a framework for planning, conducting, analyzing, and implementing fixes based on user testing with people who use assistive technologies.

## Planning User Testing

### Recruiting Participants

When recruiting participants for accessibility user testing, aim to include people with a variety of disabilities and who use different assistive technologies:

#### Types of Participants to Recruit

- Screen reader users (blind or low vision)
- Keyboard-only users (mobility impairments)
- Screen magnification users (low vision)
- Voice recognition software users (mobility impairments)
- Users with cognitive disabilities
- Users with hearing impairments
- Users with multiple disabilities

#### Where to Find Participants

- Disability organizations and advocacy groups
- Assistive technology user groups
- Social media groups focused on accessibility
- Universities and colleges (disability services offices)
- Professional accessibility testing services
- Friends and family members with disabilities

#### Compensation

Always offer fair compensation for participants' time and expertise. This could include:

- Monetary compensation
- Gift cards
- Donations to disability organizations
- Product subscriptions or credits

#### Sample Recruitment Message

```

- Post-test questionnaire
- Recording equipment
- Note-taking materials

## Conducting User Testing

### Introduction and Consent

Start the session with a clear introduction and obtain informed consent:

#### Introduction Script

```
Thank you for participating in this user testing session for Naat. My name is [Your Name], and I'll be guiding you through the session today.

The purpose of this session is to evaluate the accessibility of Naat and identify areas for improvement. We're testing the application, not you, so there are no right or wrong ways to complete the tasks.

The session will last about [duration] and will involve completing several tasks using the application. I encourage you to think aloud as you work through the tasks, sharing your thoughts, questions, and any challenges you encounter.

With your permission, we would like to record this session to help us analyze the results. The recording will only be used internally for improving the application and will not be shared publicly.

Do you have any questions before we begin?
```

#### Consent Form Elements

- What will happen during the session
- How the data will be used
- Confidentiality and privacy measures
- Permission to record
- Right to stop or take breaks at any time
- Compensation details
- Contact information for questions or concerns

### Background Questions

Gather relevant background information to help contextualize the participant's experience:

#### Sample Background Questions

1. What type of assistive technology do you use?
2. How long have you been using this assistive technology?
3. What operating system and browser do you typically use?
4. How would you rate your proficiency with your assistive technology (beginner, intermediate, advanced)?
5. How often do you use web applications similar to Naat?
6. What are some common accessibility challenges you encounter when using web applications?
7. What makes a web application particularly accessible or inaccessible for you?

### Task-Based Testing

Guide the participant through the test scenarios:

#### Task Introduction

- Clearly explain each task
- Provide context but avoid giving step-by-step instructions
- Encourage thinking aloud
- Remind participants that they can ask questions or take breaks

#### During the Task

- Observe without interrupting
- Take notes on:
  - Completion success or failure
  - Time taken
  - Errors or confusion
  - Workarounds used
  - Comments and reactions
- Ask clarifying questions only when necessary

#### After Each Task

- Ask about the participant's experience
- Probe for specific challenges or positive aspects
- Rate the difficulty of the task (1-5 scale)
- Ask for suggestions for improvement

### Post-Task Questions

After completing all tasks, ask general questions about the overall experience:

#### Sample Post-Task Questions

1. Overall, how would you rate the accessibility of Naat on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being very accessible?
2. What aspects of Naat worked well with your assistive technology?
3. What aspects of Naat were challenging or impossible to use with your assistive technology?
4. How does Naat compare to other similar applications you've used in terms of accessibility?
5. What specific improvements would make Naat more accessible for you?
6. Would you use Naat in its current state? Why or why not?

## Analyzing Results

### Identifying Issues

Review the testing data to identify accessibility issues:

#### Types of Issues to Look For

- **Critical Issues**: Prevent task completion entirely
- **Major Issues**: Significantly impede task completion
- **Minor Issues**: Cause frustration but don't prevent task completion
- **Positive Findings**: Features that work particularly well

#### Analysis Methods

- Review recordings and notes
- Identify patterns across multiple participants
- Compare experiences across different assistive technologies
- Look for both specific issues and general themes
- Consider both objective measures (task completion) and subjective feedback

### Prioritizing Issues

Prioritize issues based on impact and effort:

#### Prioritization Criteria

- **Severity**: How significantly does the issue impact users?
- **Frequency**: How often does the issue occur?
- **Scope**: How many users or user groups are affected?
- **Effort**: How difficult is the issue to fix?
- **Legal Requirements**: Does the issue violate accessibility laws or standards?

#### Prioritization Matrix

| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| P0 | Critical issues that block core functionality for many users |
| P1 | Major issues that significantly impact core functionality |
| P2 | Moderate issues that impact non-core functionality |
| P3 | Minor issues that cause frustration but don't impact functionality |
| P4 | Cosmetic issues or enhancement requests |

### Documenting Issues

Document each issue thoroughly to facilitate fixing:

#### Issue Documentation Template

```
Issue ID: [Unique identifier]
Title: [Brief description]
Priority: [P0-P4]
Affected User Groups: [Screen reader users, keyboard users, etc.]
Description: [Detailed description of the issue]

```

## Implementing Fixes

### Addressing Issues

Implement fixes based on the prioritized issues:

#### Implementation Guidelines

- Start with P0 and P1 issues
- Involve accessibility experts in the solution design
- Consider multiple approaches to solving each issue
- Test fixes with the same assistive technologies where the issues were found
- Document the changes made

### Retesting

Validate fixes through retesting:

#### Retesting Methods

- Automated testing
- Manual testing by developers
- Testing with assistive technology users
- Follow-up testing with original participants when possible

#### Retesting Documentation

- Document which issues have been fixed
- Document any new issues discovered during retesting
- Update the issue tracking system
- Communicate progress to stakeholders
