## Introduction

Accessibility is a critical aspect of our application. We aim to ensure that all users, regardless of their abilities, can use our application effectively. This document provides guidelines for testing the accessibility of our application.

## Accessibility Standards

We follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at the AA level. These guidelines cover a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible.

Key principles:
- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
- **Understandable**: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Manual Testing

### Keyboard Navigation Testing

1. **Tab Order**: Ensure that all interactive elements can be accessed using the Tab key in a logical order.
2. **Focus Visibility**: Verify that the current focus is clearly visible at all times.
3. **Keyboard Traps**: Ensure that keyboard focus is not trapped in any component.
4. **Shortcuts**: Test all keyboard shortcuts to ensure they work as expected.

### Screen Reader Testing

1. **Content Reading**: Ensure that all content is read correctly by screen readers.
2. **Interactive Elements**: Verify that all interactive elements are announced correctly.
3. **Dynamic Content**: Test that dynamic content changes are announced appropriately.
4. **ARIA Attributes**: Verify that ARIA attributes are used correctly and enhance the experience.

### Visual Testing

1. **Color Contrast**: Ensure that text has sufficient contrast against its background.
2. **Text Resizing**: Verify that the application is usable when text is resized up to 200%.
3. **Responsive Design**: Test the application at different viewport sizes.
4. **High Contrast Mode**: Test the application in high contrast mode.

## Automated Testing

We use automated testing tools to help identify accessibility issues. However, automated testing should be used as a supplement to manual testing, not a replacement.

### Jest with Testing Library

For component testing, we use Jest with React Testing Library. This allows us to test components in a way that resembles how users interact with them.

Example test for keyboard accessibility:

```tsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { axe } from 'jest-axe';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  it('should be accessible', async () => {
    const { container } = render(<MyComponent />);
    const results = await axe(container);
    expect(results).toHaveNoViolations();
  });

  it('should be navigable with keyboard', () => {
    render(<MyComponent />);
    const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Click me' });
    
    // Focus the button
    button.focus();
    expect(document.activeElement).toBe(button);
    
    // Press Enter to activate the button
    fireEvent.keyDown(button, { key: 'Enter' });
    expect(screen.getByText('Button clicked')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Cypress with Cypress-Axe

For end-to-end testing, we use Cypress with the cypress-axe plugin. This allows us to test the accessibility of our application in a real browser environment.

Example test:

```js
describe('Home Page', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.visit('/');
    cy.injectAxe();
  });

  it('should have no accessibility violations', () => {
    cy.checkA11y();
  });

  it('should navigate with keyboard', () => {
    // Focus the first element
    cy.get('body').tab();
    
    // Navigate to the login button
    cy.focused().should('have.text', 'Skip to content');
    cy.focused().tab();
    cy.focused().should('have.text', 'Login');
    
    // Press Enter to navigate to the login page
    cy.focused().type('{enter}');
    cy.url().should('include', '/login');
  });
});
```

## Testing Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure that all accessibility requirements are met:

### General

- [ ] All pages have a unique, descriptive title
- [ ] All pages have a logical heading structure
- [ ] All images have appropriate alt text
- [ ] All form fields have associated labels
- [ ] All error messages are clearly communicated
- [ ] All interactive elements have appropriate ARIA roles and attributes
- [ ] All custom components have appropriate keyboard support

### Keyboard Navigation

- [ ] All interactive elements can be accessed using the Tab key
- [ ] The tab order follows the visual layout of the page
- [ ] Focus is clearly visible at all times
- [ ] No keyboard traps exist
- [ ] All functionality is available using the keyboard alone

### Screen Readers

- [ ] All content is read correctly by screen readers
- [ ] All interactive elements are announced correctly
- [ ] Dynamic content changes are announced appropriately
- [ ] ARIA attributes are used correctly and enhance the experience
- [ ] Live regions are used for important dynamic content

### Visual

- [ ] Text has sufficient contrast against its background
- [ ] The application is usable when text is resized up to 200%
- [ ] The application is responsive and usable at different viewport sizes
- [ ] The application is usable in high contrast mode
- [ ] Color is not used as the only means of conveying information

## Reporting Issues

When reporting accessibility issues, include the following information:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the issue
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
3. **Expected Behavior**: What should happen
4. **Actual Behavior**: What actually happens
5. **Environment**: Browser, screen reader, and other relevant information
6. **Screenshots/Videos**: Visual evidence of the issue
7. **WCAG Criteria**: The specific WCAG criteria that is violated

Report issues using the standard issue template in our project management system.
